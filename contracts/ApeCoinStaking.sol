ApeStake Smart Contract Disclaimer

The ApeStake smart contract (the “Smart Contract”) was developed at the direction of the ApeCoin DAO community pursuant
to a grant by the Ape Foundation.  The grant instructs the development of the Smart Contract and the developer’s user
interface to enable a non-exclusive, user friendly means of access to the rewards program offered to the APE community
by the Ape Foundation pursuant to the specifications set forth in AIPs 21/22. The Smart Contract is made up of free,
public, open-source or source-available software deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain.

Use Disclaimer.
Your use of the Smart Contract involves various risks, including, but not limited to, losses while digital
assets are being supplied and/or removed from the Smart Contract, losses due to the volatility of token price,
risks in connection with your personal wallet access, system failures, opportunity loss while participating in the
Smart Contract, loss of tokens in connection with non-fungible token transfers, risk of cyber attack and/or security
breach, risk of legal uncertainty and/or changes in legal environment, and additional risks which may be based upon
utilization of any third party other than the Smart Contract developer who provides you with access to the Smart
Contract. Before using the Smart Contract, you should review the relevant documentation to make sure you understand
how the Smart Contract works. Additionally, because you may be able to access the Smart Contract through other web or
mobile interfaces than the Smart Contract developer’s user interface provided pursuant to the Ape Foundation grant,
you are responsible for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to understand the fees and risks they present.

THE SMART CONTRACT IS PROVIDED "AS IS", AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.
The developer was contracted by APE Foundation to develop the initial code to implement AIP 21/22.
The developer does not own or control the staking rewards program, which is run on the Smart Contracts deployed on
the Ethereum blockchain.  Upgrades and modifications will be managed in a community-driven way by holders of the APE
governance token and may be undertaken and/or implemented with no involvement of the developer.

No liability.
No developer or entity involved in creating the Smart Contract or “platform as a service” will be liable for any
claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with the Smart Contract
or the developer’s user interface provided pursuant to the Ape Foundation grant, including any direct, indirect,
incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens,
or anything else of value.

Access to Third Parties.
Any party who uses or provides access to the Smart Contract to third parties must (a) not provide such access in
violation of any applicable law or regulation, (b) inform such third parties of any and all risks, and (c) is solely
responsible to such third parties for any and all liability, claims or damages relating to such party’s provision of
access to the Smart Contract.
